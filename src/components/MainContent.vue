          I am currently working as a Front End Developer for ThriveHive, a small business
          marketing startup in Cambridge. My day to day focuses on using Javascript, and Durandal
          to build our dynamic, responsive single paged application. Some other libraries that we
          leverage are Knockout JS, Require, and jQuery.

          Previous to ThriveHive, I was a full-time student in the Web Development Immersive
          program at General Assembly focusing on Javascript, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, and D3.

          Before pivoting into web development, I was working as a Financial Advisor for Merrill
          Lynch in Cambridge, MA. In my 8 years working with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch I
          gained both face-to-face experience assisting clients with a large spectrum of financial
          needs as well as experience working as part of a team to deliver on our goals.

          My desire to work with more complex technical problems drove me to continue learning
          code. The career transition was streamlined by the WDI course that I completed at
          General Assembly.
